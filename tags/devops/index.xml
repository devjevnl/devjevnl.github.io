<p>When working in large teams, managing branches can quickly become a hassle. Comparing branches to figure out their feature set, is a time consuming and error prone activity. This should be avoided as it significantly increases the chance of releasing wrong or even broken functionality.<br>
The most ideal solution here would be to use a backlog tool (for example Azure Boards with Azure Repos or with Github) where the branches can be directly linked to backlog items and visa versa. And dotting it i&rsquo;s by implementing a proper branch naming convention.<br>
However teams that do not have these tools available to them would need to rely on just the naming convention to
help organizing and ordering branches.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="the-naming-convention">The naming convention</h2>
<p>In my experience there are a lot of different way&rsquo;s Azure DevOps projects are organized. Also in contrary to the Azure resource naming variable groups are renamable and don&rsquo;t possess an ability to hold additional metadata like tagging. This changes the approach to naming to focus much more on meaningful and descriptive naming within the context of the Azure DevOps project. Therefore a truly holistic naming of variable groups is challenging to achieve. But abiding the <a href="/posts/the-10-commandments-for-azure-naming-conventions" rel="">The 10 commandments for Azure naming conventions</a>
 should still be feasible.</p>]]></description>
