      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Pathfinder journey to establish a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE), we begin with the Envision Stage—the first of the stages. This stage creates a common frame of reference for your organization to define the CCoE&amp;rsquo;s purpose, structure, and alignment within the organization. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the introduction to this series, check out the first post: Building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;Cloud Center of Excellence: The Pathfinder Journey&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;assembling-the-pathfinder-team&#34;&gt;Assembling the Pathfinder Team&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before the actual CCoE is established, a &lt;strong&gt;Pathfinder Team&lt;/strong&gt; is formed. This team is responsible &amp;amp; accountable for implementing the &lt;strong&gt;Pathfinder Roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;, a framework designed to guide organizations through cloud adoption and governance. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the Pathfinder Team is separate from the eventual CCoE members—it plays a critical role in shaping the foundational elements of the CCoE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is well-documented, and many organizations recognize its added value in driving innovation and operational efficiency. However, while there is a wealth of information on what a CCoE is, practical guidance on how to effectively implement one is often lacking, leaving organizations with more questions than answers. Even comprehensive resources like &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreffer&#34;&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Adoption Framework&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; primarily focus on the functions of a CCoE in its end-state without delving into the intricacies of its establishment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
