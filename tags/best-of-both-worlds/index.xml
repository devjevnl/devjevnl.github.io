      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can run your Azure DevOps pipeline jobs in a container? It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to combine the benefits of Microsoft Hosted Agents and Self-Hosted Agents. In this post, I will explain what Azure DevOps Container Jobs are and how you can use them to your advantage. But first, a recap of Microsoft Hosted Agents and Self-Hosted Agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-microsoft-hosted-agents&#34;&gt;What are Microsoft Hosted Agents&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Hosted Agents are a type of agent in Azure DevOps that are hosted and managed by Microsoft. These agents are pre-configured with certain software depending upon the type of agent (Windows, macOS, or Linux) which can run jobs targeting different platforms. With Microsoft Hosted Agents you trade off control for convenience as they are an excellent choice if you need to quickly scale your operations without worrying about the underlying infrastructure management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
