    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the 6th post in the category <a href="/categories/azure-devops-fundamentals/" rel="">Azure DevOps Fundamentals</a>
 of the blog post series on working
with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps</a>
.</p>
<p>In this post, I will break down <strong>Work Items</strong> in Azure Boards. Work Items are the foundation of tracking work in Azure DevOps, and
understanding them is crucial for effectively managing projects. We will explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The different types of Work Items.</li>
<li>How Work Items tie into the Work Item Process.</li>
<li>The hierarchy of Work Items.</li>
<li>Where and how Work Items can be created.</li>
<li>Ownership and refinement responsibilities for each Work Item level.</li>
<li>Additional useful Work Item features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing compliance and governance in the cloud can be challenging, especially when it comes to an often overlooked yet critical system: your Azure DevOps organization. Ensuring proper auditing with securely stored logs in a centralized location is vital. Audit streams address this need by enabling you to send audit logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for detailed analysis and monitoring.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to automate the configuration of Azure DevOps audit streams using PowerShell. We‚Äôll focus on using a fully working script that not only automates the setup process but also ensures drift control. This guarantees that audit logs are consistently sent to your desired Log Analytics Workspace without the need for manual intervention. Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>With this post I want to share a lazy and a hacky way for finding the Azure DevOps <code>Project Id</code> of any project in your Azure DevOps Organization.</p>
<h2 id="the-lazy-api-query">The lazy API query</h2>
<p>It can feel a bit daunting to start using Azure DevOps API. But what most folks are not aware of is that data retrieval API&rsquo;s can be queried using
your favorite browser.
To get the <code>Project Id</code> we can do this with the projects <code>LIST</code> and <code>GET</code> API&rsquo;s.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022 I wrote a blog post <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!</a>
 about how secrets can be leaked in <code>Azure Pipelines</code>.
I think it&rsquo;s time to offset that blog post and have a look at how compliance of all pipelines in a single <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps Project</a>
 can be achieved. This is done by using a feature called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-pipeline-decorator?view=azure-devops&amp;wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pipeline Decorators</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-pipeline-decorators">What are pipeline decorators?</h2>
<p>In most organizations there are certain required compliance and security policies. For example; to be compliant with corporate policies a static code analysis tool must to be executed on all pipelines before executing the actual pipeline tasks. This is where pipeline decorators come in, pipeline authors don&rsquo;t need to remember to add that step. We as <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> owners create a decorator that automatically injects the step into all pipelines during their runtime. Ensuring on an <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> level that all pipelines are compliant with our organization&rsquo;s policies.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that you can run your Azure DevOps pipeline jobs in a container? It&rsquo;s a great way to combine the benefits of Microsoft Hosted Agents and Self-Hosted Agents. In this post, I will explain what Azure DevOps Container Jobs are and how you can use them to your advantage. But first, a recap of Microsoft Hosted Agents and Self-Hosted Agents.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-microsoft-hosted-agents">What are Microsoft Hosted Agents</h2>
<p>Microsoft Hosted Agents are a type of agent in Azure DevOps that are hosted and managed by Microsoft. These agents are pre-configured with certain software depending upon the type of agent (Windows, macOS, or Linux) which can run jobs targeting different platforms. With Microsoft Hosted Agents you trade off control for convenience as they are an excellent choice if you need to quickly scale your operations without worrying about the underlying infrastructure management.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
 is a comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, tools, and documentation. But, this comprehensiveness can render the framework complex and potentially overwhelming for individuals and organizations, most notably for those with limited cloud expertise.
As an attempt to offset the complexity I created a ready to use quick start backlog for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Design Areas</a>
 sub-section of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
. Via this blog post I want to share it, explain the composition and guide you on how import it into your own Azure DevOps organization within minutes.</p>]]></description>
