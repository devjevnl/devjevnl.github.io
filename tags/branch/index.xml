<p>When working in large teams, managing branches can quickly become a hassle. Comparing branches to figure out their feature set, is a time consuming and error prone activity. This should be avoided as it significantly increases the chance of releasing wrong or even broken functionality.<br>
The most ideal solution here would be to use a backlog tool (for example Azure Boards with Azure Repos or with Github) where the branches can be directly linked to backlog items and visa versa. And dotting it i&rsquo;s by implementing a proper branch naming convention.<br>
However teams that do not have these tools available to them would need to rely on just the naming convention to
help organizing and ordering branches.</p>]]></description>
