    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>While this case is not a particularly new one and has been posted by Matt Cooper on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/pipeline-stealing-another-repo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">devblogs.microsoft.com</a>
 back in August 2020. I still feel that in relation to the possible data spillage it has not received sufficient exposure and the correct amount of awareness I would have expected. I actually stumbled upon this case by accident when playing with the Azure DevOps Library variables API.</p>
<p>So in this post I want to showcase how a possible attacker can use a compromised developers environment to gain access to almost all the data present in an Azure DevOps Organization. While access of the developers environment in question is limited to just a single Azure DevOps Project.</p>]]></description>
