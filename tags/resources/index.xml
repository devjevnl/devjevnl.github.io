    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will share a couple of tips with regards to <code>Secrets Management</code> in your (local) dev environment. Personally I use these to prevent / limit leaking of secrets while developing Azure infrastructure. And I consider them as part of my security hygiene during the development process.</p>
<p>Last year I wrote a <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">series</a>
 of posts covering the <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">naming convention</a>
 topic. <a href="/posts/the-perfect-azure-naming-convention" rel="">The perfect azure naming convention</a>
 covered the Azure resources. The primary concept for this naming convention is that in fact Azure resource names are actually ID&rsquo;s which cannot be renamed. In this post I want to share a method with which renamable display names can be added.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This post is the 2nd in the <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">naming convention series</a>
. With this post I want to share my approach to naming Azure resources. Why a naming convention is important is already covered by my <a href="/posts/2022/the-10-commandments-for-azure-naming-conventions" rel="">previous post</a>
. However I do believe that some background is required to understand this approach. So, lets dig in.</p>
