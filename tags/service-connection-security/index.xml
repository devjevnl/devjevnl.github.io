      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like with the two previous posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/hacking-azure-devops&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;Hacking Azure DevOps&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; I want to continue to raise awareness and understanding about pipeline security in Azure DevOps. In the previous post I have explained how secure / marked as secret variables are handled during pipeline runtime.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this post I want to show how an Azure Resource Manager service connection configuration is handled during pipeline runtime. And which sensitive information is exposed through this service connection.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Like I mentioned in the  previous posts, without proper security configuration for pipelines this information could be abused by attackers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
