    <description><![CDATA[<p>Like with the two previous posts <a href="/posts/2022/hacking-azure-devops" rel="">Hacking Azure DevOps</a>
 and <a href="/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets" rel="">I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!</a>
 I want to continue to raise awareness and understanding about pipeline security in Azure DevOps. In the previous post I have explained how secure / marked as secret variables are handled during pipeline runtime.<br>
In this post I want to show how an Azure Resource Manager service connection configuration is handled during pipeline runtime. And which sensitive information is exposed through this service connection.<br>
Like I mentioned in the  previous posts, without proper security configuration for pipelines this information could be abused by attackers.</p>]]></description>
