<p><em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t move fast if no one&rsquo;s steering in the same direction.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far in our <em>Building a Cloud Center of Excellence</em> series, we&rsquo;ve explored the big picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/" rel=""><strong>The Pathfinder Journey</strong></a>
, we set the stage for the transformation ahead, breaking down the roadmap to cloud maturity.</li>
<li>In <a href="/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-envision-stage/" rel=""><strong>The Envision Stage</strong></a>
, we defined the <em>why</em> behind the CCoE, clarifying the vision, building a common frame of reference, and securing leadership buy-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to shift gears. The vision is clear, but <strong>alignment</strong> is what turns that vision into an actionable strategy. This is where planning gets real, responsibilities take shape, and the CCoE begins to operate as more than just an idea.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="understanding-the-need-for-management-group-automation">Understanding the Need for Management Group Automation</h2>
<p>Managing Azure subscriptions at scale can become challenging. Management groups provide a powerful way to organize and govern resources, but manually configuring them introduces inefficiencies and risks. A common pitfall is hardcoding management group structures into deployment code, which reduces flexibility and can compromise governance.
This post introduces Management Group Vending, a reusable Bicep solution inspired by Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Subscription Vending</a>
. This solution enables you to deploy any management group hierarchy, considering Azure&rsquo;s limitations while adhering to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022 I wrote a blog post <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!</a>
 about how secrets can be leaked in <code>Azure Pipelines</code>.
I think it&rsquo;s time to offset that blog post and have a look at how compliance of all pipelines in a single <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps Project</a>
 can be achieved. This is done by using a feature called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-pipeline-decorator?view=azure-devops&amp;wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pipeline Decorators</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-pipeline-decorators">What are pipeline decorators?</h2>
<p>In most organizations there are certain required compliance and security policies. For example; to be compliant with corporate policies a static code analysis tool must to be executed on all pipelines before executing the actual pipeline tasks. This is where pipeline decorators come in, pipeline authors don&rsquo;t need to remember to add that step. We as <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> owners create a decorator that automatically injects the step into all pipelines during their runtime. Ensuring on an <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> level that all pipelines are compliant with our organization&rsquo;s policies.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will share a couple of tips with regards to <code>Secrets Management</code> in your (local) dev environment. Personally I use these to prevent / limit leaking of secrets while developing Azure infrastructure. And I consider them as part of my security hygiene during the development process.</p>
<p>Last year I wrote a <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">series</a>
 of posts covering the <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">naming convention</a>
 topic. <a href="/posts/the-perfect-azure-naming-convention" rel="">The perfect azure naming convention</a>
 covered the Azure resources. The primary concept for this naming convention is that in fact Azure resource names are actually ID&rsquo;s which cannot be renamed. In this post I want to share a method with which renamable display names can be added.</p>]]></description>

For every 10 engineers and architects asked you will get 10 different replies on such a topic as naming conventions. With this blog post I would like to kick-off a small <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">series</a>
 of blog posts sharing my view points about Azure related naming conventions. In this post starting with why a proper naming convention is important and the 10 commandments I generally follow when working on a naming convention.</p>]]></description>
