<p>In our Pathfinder journey to establish a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE), we begin with the Envision Stage—the first of the stages. This stage creates a common frame of reference for your organization to define the CCoE’s purpose, structure, and alignment within the organization. If you haven&rsquo;t read the introduction to this series, check out the first post: Building a <a href="/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/" rel="">Cloud Center of Excellence: The Pathfinder Journey</a>

<h2 id="assembling-the-pathfinder-team">Assembling the Pathfinder Team</h2>
<p>Before the actual CCoE is established, a <strong>Pathfinder Team</strong> is formed. This team is responsible &amp; accountable for implementing the <strong>Pathfinder Roadmap</strong>, a framework designed to guide organizations through cloud adoption and governance. It&rsquo;s important to note that the Pathfinder Team is separate from the eventual CCoE members—it plays a critical role in shaping the foundational elements of the CCoE.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is well-documented, and many organizations recognize its added value in driving innovation and operational efficiency. However, while there is a wealth of information on what a CCoE is, practical guidance on how to effectively implement one is often lacking, leaving organizations with more questions than answers. Even comprehensive resources like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft&rsquo;s Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
 primarily focus on the functions of a CCoE in its end-state without delving into the intricacies of its establishment.</p>]]></description>
