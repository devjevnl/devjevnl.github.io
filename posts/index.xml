    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="envision-stage">Envision Stage</h1>
<p>In our Pathfinder journey to establish a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE), we begin with the Envision Stage‚Äîthe first of the stages. This stage creates a common frame of reference for your organization to define the CCoE‚Äôs purpose, structure, and alignment within the organization. If you haven&rsquo;t read the introduction to this series, check out the first post: Building a <a href="/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/" rel="">Cloud Center of Excellence: The Pathfinder Journey</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="assembling-the-pathfinder-team">Assembling the Pathfinder Team</h2>
<p>Before the actual CCoE is established, a <strong>Pathfinder Team</strong> is formed. This team is responsible &amp; accountable for implementing the <strong>Pathfinder Roadmap</strong>, a framework designed to guide organizations through cloud adoption and governance. It&rsquo;s important to note that the Pathfinder Team is separate from the eventual CCoE members‚Äîit plays a critical role in shaping the foundational elements of the CCoE.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is well-documented, and many organizations recognize its added value in driving innovation and operational efficiency. However, while there is a wealth of information on what a CCoE is, practical guidance on how to effectively implement one is often lacking, leaving organizations with more questions than answers. Even comprehensive resources like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft&rsquo;s Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
 primarily focus on the functions of a CCoE in its end-state without delving into the intricacies of its establishment.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the 6th post in the category <a href="/categories/azure-devops-fundamentals/" rel="">Azure DevOps Fundamentals</a>
 of the blog post series on working
with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps</a>
.</p>
<p>In this post, I will break down <strong>Work Items</strong> in Azure Boards. Work Items are the foundation of tracking work in Azure DevOps, and
understanding them is crucial for effectively managing projects. We will explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The different types of Work Items.</li>
<li>How Work Items tie into the Work Item Process.</li>
<li>The hierarchy of Work Items.</li>
<li>Where and how Work Items can be created.</li>
<li>Ownership and refinement responsibilities for each Work Item level.</li>
<li>Additional useful Work Item features.</li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing compliance and governance in the cloud can be challenging, especially when it comes to an often overlooked yet critical system: your Azure DevOps organization. Ensuring proper auditing with securely stored logs in a centralized location is vital. Audit streams address this need by enabling you to send audit logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for detailed analysis and monitoring.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to automate the configuration of Azure DevOps audit streams using PowerShell. We‚Äôll focus on using a fully working script that not only automates the setup process but also ensures drift control. This guarantees that audit logs are consistently sent to your desired Log Analytics Workspace without the need for manual intervention. Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="understanding-the-need-for-management-group-automation">Understanding the Need for Management Group Automation</h2>
<p>Managing Azure subscriptions at scale can become challenging. Management groups provide a powerful way to organize and govern resources, but manually configuring them introduces inefficiencies and risks. A common pitfall is hardcoding management group structures into deployment code, which reduces flexibility and can compromise governance.
This post introduces Management Group Vending, a reusable Bicep solution inspired by Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Subscription Vending</a>
. This solution enables you to deploy any management group hierarchy, considering Azure&rsquo;s limitations while adhering to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <em><strong>Decoding Microsoft Azure</strong></em> post, <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2024/decoding-microsoft-azure-understanding-platform-landing-zones-workloads-and-utilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">üîç <em>Decoding Microsoft Azure: Understanding Platform, Landing Zones, Workloads, and Utilities ‚öôÔ∏è</em></a>
, I introduced <em><strong>the house analogy</strong></em> to conceptually explain <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Azure</a>
. Part of this analogy covered the <strong>Application Landing Zone</strong> and the <strong>Platform Landing Zone</strong>.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll take a deeper dive into Landing Zones. We&rsquo;ll explore what they are, how they&rsquo;re defined by Microsoft, and how I believe we can improve upon the concept. By the end, you&rsquo;ll have a clearer understanding of Azure Landing Zones and how they fit into a broader cloud adoption strategy.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>With this post I want to share a lazy and a hacky way for finding the Azure DevOps <code>Project Id</code> of any project in your Azure DevOps Organization.</p>
<h2 id="the-lazy-api-query">The lazy API query</h2>
<p>It can feel a bit daunting to start using Azure DevOps API. But what most folks are not aware of is that data retrieval API&rsquo;s can be queried using
your favorite browser.
To get the <code>Project Id</code> we can do this with the projects <code>LIST</code> and <code>GET</code> API&rsquo;s.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The task of explaining concepts of the Microsoft Azure Cloud befalls to us Cloud consultants. Usually we have to explain these concepts to stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise. So using a simple analogy often helps to clarify complex ideas. In this post I want to share my favorite analogy. The house analogy! I am sure that I am not the first to come up with this analogy, however if you like my variation, feel free to use it in your own presentations or discussions.</p>]]></description>
