    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the 6th post in the category <a href="/categories/azure-devops-fundamentals/" rel="">Azure DevOps Fundamentals</a>
 of the blog post series on working
with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps</a>
.</p>
<p>In this post, I will break down <strong>Work Items</strong> in Azure Boards. Work Items are the foundation of tracking work in Azure DevOps, and
understanding them is crucial for effectively managing projects. We will explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The different types of Work Items.</li>
<li>How Work Items tie into the Work Item Process.</li>
<li>The hierarchy of Work Items.</li>
<li>Where and how Work Items can be created.</li>
<li>Ownership and refinement responsibilities for each Work Item level.</li>
<li>Additional useful Work Item features.</li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing compliance and governance in the cloud can be challenging, especially when it comes to an often overlooked yet critical system: your Azure DevOps organization. Ensuring proper auditing with securely stored logs in a centralized location is vital. Audit streams address this need by enabling you to send audit logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for detailed analysis and monitoring.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to automate the configuration of Azure DevOps audit streams using PowerShell. We‚Äôll focus on using a fully working script that not only automates the setup process but also ensures drift control. This guarantees that audit logs are consistently sent to your desired Log Analytics Workspace without the need for manual intervention. Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="understanding-the-need-for-management-group-automation">Understanding the Need for Management Group Automation</h2>
<p>Managing Azure subscriptions at scale can become challenging. Management groups provide a powerful way to organize and govern resources, but manually configuring them introduces inefficiencies and risks. A common pitfall is hardcoding management group structures into deployment code, which reduces flexibility and can compromise governance.
This post introduces Management Group Vending, a reusable Bicep solution inspired by Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Subscription Vending</a>
. This solution enables you to deploy any management group hierarchy, considering Azure&rsquo;s limitations while adhering to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In my previous <em><strong>Decoding Microsoft Azure</strong></em> post, <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2024/decoding-microsoft-azure-understanding-platform-landing-zones-workloads-and-utilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">üîç <em>Decoding Microsoft Azure: Understanding Platform, Landing Zones, Workloads, and Utilities ‚öôÔ∏è</em></a>
, I introduced <em><strong>the house analogy</strong></em> to conceptually explain <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Azure</a>
. Part of this analogy covered the <strong>Application Landing Zone</strong> and the <strong>Platform Landing Zone</strong>.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll take a deeper dive into Landing Zones. We&rsquo;ll explore what they are, how they&rsquo;re defined by Microsoft, and how I believe we can improve upon the concept. By the end, you&rsquo;ll have a clearer understanding of Azure Landing Zones and how they fit into a broader cloud adoption strategy.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id="the-lazy-api-query">The lazy API query</h2>
<p>It can feel a bit daunting to start using Azure DevOps API. But what most folks are not aware of is that data retrieval API&rsquo;s can be queried using
your favorite browser.
To get the <code>Project Id</code> we can do this with the projects <code>LIST</code> and <code>GET</code> API&rsquo;s.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The task of explaining concepts of the Microsoft Azure Cloud befalls to us Cloud consultants. Usually we have to explain these concepts to stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise. So using a simple analogy often helps to clarify complex ideas. In this post I want to share my favorite analogy. The house analogy! I am sure that I am not the first to come up with this analogy, however if you like my variation, feel free to use it in your own presentations or discussions.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022 I wrote a blog post <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!</a>
 about how secrets can be leaked in <code>Azure Pipelines</code>.
I think it&rsquo;s time to offset that blog post and have a look at how compliance of all pipelines in a single <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Azure DevOps Project</a>
 can be achieved. This is done by using a feature called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-pipeline-decorator?view=azure-devops&amp;wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pipeline Decorators</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-pipeline-decorators">What are pipeline decorators?</h2>
<p>In most organizations there are certain required compliance and security policies. For example; to be compliant with corporate policies a static code analysis tool must to be executed on all pipelines before executing the actual pipeline tasks. This is where pipeline decorators come in, pipeline authors don&rsquo;t need to remember to add that step. We as <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> owners create a decorator that automatically injects the step into all pipelines during their runtime. Ensuring on an <code>Azure DevOps Organization</code> level that all pipelines are compliant with our organization&rsquo;s policies.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>While this post is outside of my usual topics, I would like to share a solution for an error message which returns just a single search result on Google. I want to share it because it took me some time to figure out what was going on. So in case someone else runs into this issue this post might be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>
<p>It all started after the network team updated the network to a new public IP. Right after this change all users started to get the error message <code>400 Bad Request.
