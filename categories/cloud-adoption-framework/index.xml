    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="envision-stage">Envision Stage</h1>
<p>In our Pathfinder journey to establish a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE), we begin with the Envision Stage—the first of the stages. This stage creates a common frame of reference for your organization to define the CCoE’s purpose, structure, and alignment within the organization. If you haven&rsquo;t read the introduction to this series, check out the first post: Building a <a href="/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/" rel="">Cloud Center of Excellence: The Pathfinder Journey</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="assembling-the-pathfinder-team">Assembling the Pathfinder Team</h2>
<p>Before the actual CCoE is established, a <strong>Pathfinder Team</strong> is formed. This team is responsible &amp; accountable for implementing the <strong>Pathfinder Roadmap</strong>, a framework designed to guide organizations through cloud adoption and governance. It&rsquo;s important to note that the Pathfinder Team is separate from the eventual CCoE members—it plays a critical role in shaping the foundational elements of the CCoE.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is well-documented, and many organizations recognize its added value in driving innovation and operational efficiency. However, while there is a wealth of information on what a CCoE is, practical guidance on how to effectively implement one is often lacking, leaving organizations with more questions than answers. Even comprehensive resources like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft&rsquo;s Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
 primarily focus on the functions of a CCoE in its end-state without delving into the intricacies of its establishment.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
 is a comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, tools, and documentation. But, this comprehensiveness can render the framework complex and potentially overwhelming for individuals and organizations, most notably for those with limited cloud expertise.
As an attempt to offset the complexity I created a ready to use quick start backlog for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Design Areas</a>
 sub-section of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework</a>
. Via this blog post I want to share it, explain the composition and guide you on how import it into your own Azure DevOps organization within minutes.</p>]]></description>
