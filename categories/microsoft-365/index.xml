    <description><![CDATA[<p>While this post is outside of my usual topics, I would like to share a solution for an error message which returns just a single search result on Google. I want to share it because it took me some time to figure out what was going on. So in case someone else runs into this issue this post might be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>
<p>It all started after the network team updated the network to a new public IP. Right after this change all users started to get the error message <code>400 Bad Request. QWNjZXNzIHRvIE91dGxvb2sgb24gdGhlIHdlYiBoYXMgYmVlbiBibG9ja2VkIGJ5 IHlvdXIgb3JnYW5pemF0aW9uLiA8QlI+PEJSPkNsaWNrIDxhIGhyZWY9Ii9vd2Ev bG9nb2ZmLm93YSI+aGVyZTwvYT4gdG8gc2lnbiBvdXQu (Base64)</code> when trying to access Outlook on the web (OWA) in Microsoft 365.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Back when all the Cloud and SaaS offerings where a brand new concept most IT administrators ended up choosing the domain name of a tenant. This choice would be then reflected in the SharePoint Online url and the only way to change it was to create brand new tenant. Either due to the somewhat poor choice from the IT administrators, due to mergers, rebranding or acquisitions some organization ended up with lets say less desirable domain name for their SharePoint URL.<br>
Responding to clients with a &ldquo;no it is not possible to change that&rdquo; always bothered me back then. So when I learned that this option is now available (in preview) I immediately decided to try it. Via this post I want to share what I learned testing this option.</p>]]></description>
