      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2022/getting-along-with-winget-basic-commands&#34;&gt;Getting Along With Winget - Basic Packed Management&lt;/a&gt; I went trough my experiences with using the basic Winget commands. And mentioned that anyone who needs more control over the installation options will quickly note that when Winget uses the default installation options when installing packages. In this post I would like to share with you how I managed to solve this and get the control I need during the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my summer holiday I had a one day break from sunny weather so I decided to use the family tablet to fiddle with some PowerShell.&#xA;As expected only the standard software was installed on the tablet. I could either start installing everything I need manually or use this opportunity dig a bit into &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;winget&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you will enjoy both the basics and the advanced configuration experience shared via this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
