    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t move fast if no one&rsquo;s steering in the same direction.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far in our <em>Building a Cloud Center of Excellence</em> series, we&rsquo;ve explored the big picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-pathfinder-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><strong>The Pathfinder Journey</strong></a>
, we set the stage for the transformation ahead, breaking down the roadmap to cloud maturity.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.devjev.nl/posts/2025/building-a-cloud-center-of-excellence-the-envision-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"><strong>The Envision Stage</strong></a>
, we defined the <em>why</em> behind the CCoE, clarifying the vision, building a common frame of reference, and securing leadership buy-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to shift gears. The vision is clear, but <strong>alignment</strong> is what turns that vision into an actionable strategy. This is where planning gets real, responsibilities take shape, and the CCoE begins to operate as more than just an idea.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="understanding-the-need-for-management-group-automation">Understanding the Need for Management Group Automation</h2>
<p>Managing Azure subscriptions at scale can become challenging. Management groups provide a powerful way to organize and govern resources, but manually configuring them introduces inefficiencies and risks. A common pitfall is hardcoding management group structures into deployment code, which reduces flexibility and can compromise governance.
This post introduces Management Group Vending, a reusable Bicep solution inspired by Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Subscription Vending</a>
. This solution enables you to deploy any management group hierarchy, considering Azure&rsquo;s limitations while adhering to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>With this post I want to share a lazy and a hacky way for finding the Azure DevOps <code>Project Id</code> of any project in your Azure DevOps Organization.</p>
<h2 id="the-lazy-api-query">The lazy API query</h2>
<p>It can feel a bit daunting to start using Azure DevOps API. But what most folks are not aware of is that data retrieval API&rsquo;s can be queried using
your favorite browser.
To get the <code>Project Id</code> we can do this with the projects <code>LIST</code> and <code>GET</code> API&rsquo;s.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I always struggled with the following; when I find a solution for a certain problem and months down the line I run into a similar problem and try to remember how I solved the previous one. Cursing at myself: Why didn&rsquo;t I write this down!? Like many other IT professionals I created a blog (years ago) to write those solutions down for myself and anyone who stumbles upon the blog. But unfortunately my blog at that time has followed the trend of the general population of IT related blogs. It withered away due to the lack of attention from yours truly.</p>]]></description>
