    <description><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s cloud-driven landscape, security is a shared responsibility for developers and engineers alike. Azure Bastion&rsquo;s Developer SKU offers a lightweight way to securely connect to virtual machinesâ€”and did I mention it&rsquo;s free? ðŸŽ‰ In this post, we&rsquo;ll walk through setting up Azure Bastion Developer SKU using Bicep Infrastructure as Code, fostering a &ldquo;<strong>security is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility</strong>&rdquo; mindset as we go.</p>

. This starter kit is based on best practices, personal experiences, and guidelines for creating and organizing code and resources tailored for Azure infrastructure deployment. While the example itself is based on a combination of Azure DevOps, Bicep and PowerShell, the concepts are applicable to any IaC language and tool combination.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I will share a couple of tips with regards to <code>Secrets Management</code> in your (local) dev environment. Personally I use these to prevent / limit leaking of secrets while developing Azure infrastructure. And I consider them as part of my security hygiene during the development process.</p>
<p>Last year I wrote a <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">series</a>
 of posts covering the <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">naming convention</a>
 topic. <a href="/posts/the-perfect-azure-naming-convention" rel="">The perfect azure naming convention</a>
 covered the Azure resources. The primary concept for this naming convention is that in fact Azure resource names are actually ID&rsquo;s which cannot be renamed. In this post I want to share a method with which renamable display names can be added.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This post is the 2nd in the <a href="/categories/naming-conventions/" rel="">naming convention series</a>
. With this post I want to share my approach to naming Azure resources. Why a naming convention is important is already covered by my <a href="/posts/2022/the-10-commandments-for-azure-naming-conventions" rel="">previous post</a>
. However I do believe that some background is required to understand this approach. So, lets dig in.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Like with the two previous posts <a href="/posts/2022/hacking-azure-devops" rel="">Hacking Azure DevOps</a>
 and <a href="/posts/2022/i-am-in-your-pipeline-reading-all-your-secrets" rel="">I am in your pipeline reading all your secrets!</a>
 I want to continue to raise awareness and understanding about pipeline security in Azure DevOps. In the previous post I have explained how secure / marked as secret variables are handled during pipeline runtime.<br>
In this post I want to show how an Azure Resource Manager service connection configuration is handled during pipeline runtime. And which sensitive information is exposed through this service connection.<br>
Like I mentioned in the  previous posts, without proper security configuration for pipelines this information could be abused by attackers.</p>]]></description>
